## APIs

You can also interact with JANKO via its APIs. This allows you to use the platform without needing to navigate its UI in your web browser.

> NOTE: To perform any operation via this API, you'll need to first log in (or register).

There are three sets of APIs in JANKO:

- `/auth`: Log into JANKO or register a new account
- `/profile`: Create and update user profile information
- `/articles`: Create, read, update and delete articles
