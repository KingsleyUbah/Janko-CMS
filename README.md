## JANKO CMS

JANKO is a content management system that allows you to sign up for an account and create a post. You're to provide the post body in markdown format (JANKO will parse the markdown into text).

Here's a short DEMO of the application:

## APIs

You can also interact with JANKO via its APIs. This allows you to use the platform without needing to navigate its UI in your web browser.

> NOTE: To perform any operation via this API, you'll need to first log in (or register).

There are three sets of APIs in JANKO:

- `/auth`: Log into JANKO or register a new account
- `/profile`: Create and update user profile information
- `/articles`: Create, read, update and delete articles

Here's the full list of available endpoints:
